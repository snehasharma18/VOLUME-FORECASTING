# Volume-Forecasting
Volumes Forecasting

This Python script is a Streamlit-powered web application for volume forecasting using the Prophet time series forecasting model. It loads historical data from an Excel file, preprocesses it, and allows users to interactively select regions, subprocesses, and functions for forecasting. Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the application retrains the forecasting model on user-selected parameters and displays the forecasted values in a table and an interactive Plotly line chart. Additionally, it provides the option to download the forecasted values as a CSV file. This tool serves as a user-friendly interface for exploring and generating volume forecasts based on historical data.
